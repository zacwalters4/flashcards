# FlashCards

## Abstract

This application allows the user to play the flashcard quiz game in their terminal. Users will be given a multiple choice question that they must answer before moving on to the next question.

## Technologies used

In this project I exclusively used JavaScript. Within JS I created several classes and tested them using mocha and chai before fleshing out the functionality of each class. 

## Setup Instructions

Clone down the repo.

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and run:
